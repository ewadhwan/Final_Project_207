Summer 2024 

Student dropout is a significant issue in the education system and can lead to several other problems in the future. High drop-out rates can contribute to a less skilled workforce, which in turn leads to higher unemployment rates and lower lifetime earnings. And then this not only affects the individual but also the overall economic growth of the community.  Secondly, increased drop-out rates are associated with higher crime rates and greater social dependency. Lastly, educational institutions also suffer when drop-out rates are high, as this negatively affects their reputation, funding, and morale. 

For our final project, we aimed to answer the research question of \mathit{'What are the leading factors of student dropout in higher education?}' This is important because the ability to predict drop-out rates allows for proactive intervention and schools can implement targeted support and intervention programs to help these students stay on track. To predict student dropout rates, we created 4 different models (baseline, logistic regression, random forest, neural network) and compared their accuracy. 

We downloaded our dataset from this link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success

In our repository, you will find two Jupyter Notebooks. The first contains all of our exploratory data analysis and associated visuals. The second notebook contains our modeling and hyperparameter experiments.
